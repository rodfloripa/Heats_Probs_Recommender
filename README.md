Fig. 1. The HeatS (A, B, C) and ProbS (D, E, F) algorithms  at
work on the bipartite user-object network. Objects are shown as squares,
users as circles, with the target user indicated by the shaded circle. While
the HeatS algorithm redistributes resource via a nearest-neighbor averaging
process, the ProbS algorithm works by an equal distribution of resource
among nearest neighbors.
